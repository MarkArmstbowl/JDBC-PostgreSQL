# JDBC-PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL Database Web Application 
This is an educational management system to handle student profiles, faculty assignments, course enrollments, and 
academic records.
It modeled a normalized PostgreSQL relational schema (3NF), enforced consistency with SQL triggers, and deployed dynamic 
web forms using JSP/JDBC for database interaction.
